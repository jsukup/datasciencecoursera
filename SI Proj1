#Summary

In a few (2-3) sentences explain what is going to be reported on.

#Simulations of Exponential Distribution

```{r}
exp <- NULL
for(i in 1:1000) exp <-  c(exp, mean(rexp(40, rate = .2)))

```

Simulations: Include English explanations of the simulations you ran, with the accompanying R code. Your explanations should make clear what the R code accomplishes.

#Comparison of Sample Mean vs. Theoretical Mean

Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean: Include figures with titles. In the figures, highlight the means you are comparing. Include text that explains the figures and what is shown on them, and provides appropriate numbers.

#Comparison of Sample Variace vs. Theoretical Variance

Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance: Include figures (output from R) with titles. Highlight the variances you are comparing. Include text that explains your understanding of the differences of the variances.

#Normal Distribution via Central Limit Theorum

Distribution: Via figures and text, explain how one can tell the distribution is approximately normal.
